Trip phases:
If we have a non-empty itinerary, follow the following logic to deteermine a Trip phase:
- First focus on the start_date "{itinerary_start_date}" and the end_date "{itinerary_end_date}" of the itinerary.
- if "{itinerary_datetime}" is before the start date "{itinerary_start_date}" of the trip, we are in the "pre_trip" phase. 
- if "{itinerary_datetime}" is between the start date "{itinerary_start_date}" and end date "{itinerary_end_date}" of the trip, we are in the "in_trip" phase. 
- When we are in the "in_trip" phase, the "{itinerary_datetime}" dictates if we have "day_of" matters to handle.
- if "{itinerary_datetime}" is after the end date of the trip, we are in the "post_trip" phase. 

<itinerary>
{itinerary}
</itinerary>

Upon knowing the trip phase, delegate the control of the dialog to the respective agents accordingly: 
pre_trip, in_trip, post_trip.
